Description: An R interface to the 'oras' client. The 'oras' client
  provides a mechanism to interact with Open Container Initiative ('OCI')
  container registeries as content-addressed storage. This allows users
  to easily publish public or private data to any compliant container 
  registry, such as the GitHub Container Registry.
